we are making a rest api with a database
a car dealership:
- we have cars in the dealership
- cars have the following info describing them:
	- name
	- manufacture date
	- fuel consumption
	- horsepower
	- manufacturer
	- fuel type
- we also hold manufacturer info which includes:
	- name
	- country of origin

we need to be able to: c r u d DATABASE
- create new entries
- retreive existing data
	- all
	- singular
- update existing data
	- full overwrite
	- partial update
- delete data

we need to follow the layer system:
presentation 	- expose data from service to the user
service 	- use functionality of the persistance layer to solve problems our specification dictates
persistance 	- handles interactions with the db, works with entities
